      * **Education **: PhD.

      * **Current research **: My research focuses on pre-clinic experiments to
      investigate human cancerous processes and mechanisms by using
      immunodeficient laboratory mouse models (breast cancer, pancreas cancer,
      lung and liver metastases, etc.) in order to explore and develop novel
      therapies for cancer treatment.
