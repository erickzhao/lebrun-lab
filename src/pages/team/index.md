      * **Education **: B.Sc. in Biopharmaceutical Sciences, Université de
      Montréal.

      * **Current research :** Evaluation of the therapeutic potential of a
      certain TGFb-mediated microRNA found to be upregulated in triple negative
      breast cancer. This is being tested in vitro as well as in vivo using
      CRISPR/Cas technology.

      * **Education **: PhD.

      * **Current research **: My research focuses on pre-clinic experiments to
      investigate human cancerous processes and mechanisms by using
      immunodeficient laboratory mouse models (breast cancer, pancreas cancer,
      lung and liver metastases, etc.) in order to explore and develop novel
      therapies for cancer treatment.
