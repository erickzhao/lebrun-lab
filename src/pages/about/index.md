# Based in Montréal, Canada, the Lebrun Lab is part of the Cancer Research Program at the  McGill University Health Center Research Institute

The MUHC-RI Hospital offers a state of the art research institute equipped with powerful biomedical instruments. The MUHC is an internationally recognized biomedical and healthcare hospital research center, with over 500 researchers, 1,000 graduate and postdoctoral students. The MUHC-RI is a unique medical and life sciences research facility in Canada, equipped with state-of-the-art technologies, cutting-edge core facilities (imaging, flow cytometry) and proteomic core unit for MS. The ultra-modern vivarium and associated staff is fully-ready for all surgical procedures and bio-imaging analysis.

Overall, the vision/direction of our research program aims at understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying tumor initiation, progression and drug resistance in metastatic cancer, all of which considered as major challenges in the management of cancer patients. Metastatic cancer is by large an incurable disease, responsible for 90% of cancer deaths and lacks effective targeted therapies. Our mission and long-term goal are to advance and accelerate the translation of basic laboratory discoveries into new cancer therapeutics against this deadly disease. To achieve these objectives, our lab has developed central lines of research using cellular systems (in vitro), patient-derived organoids (ex-vivo), patient-derived preclinical xenografts (in vivo), bioinformatics and data mining analysis for large cohorts of human patient datasets (in silico). Using state of the art technologies, gene editing (CRISPR) and genome-wide molecular approaches, our lab has also developed a cutting edge “Crisperized Medicine” research program.
